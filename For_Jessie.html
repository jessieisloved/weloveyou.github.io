<h1>Jessie Buestan, A Goddess</h1>
<p>For Jessie....one of the few people that made an enormous impact on my life. Kind regardless of anything else, to anyone. She matters to me beyond anything. I would absolutely gladly give my own life to her, no matter what it would be for. She is an amazing friend, super supportive, loves everyone, and means a lot to anyone that truly gets to know her. She's more gorgeous, breathtaking, beautiful than anyone else I have ever seen. I have actually never done this for anyone else, but I would literally do anything for Jessie. Even as a friend, which I am extraordinarily happy about her allowing me to be, she radiates kindness and light, like an angel, or a goddess. She's one of those people that is impossible to hate. I know I wasn't exactly the greatest person to her at the beginning of 6th grade, but I'd like to think my status with her has changed since then, and I truly want to believe that I'll see her again someday. No matter what, she'll mean the world to me. Whatever I have done wrong to her, I apologize immensely, with the hopes that she decides to forgive me. If not, I swear to do anything I can to support and help her when she's not feeling the greatest (which is rare).I want her to always be happy to support her every decision, no matter what, and walk with her until the end.I honestly, truly, love her.</p>
